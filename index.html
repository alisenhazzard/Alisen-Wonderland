                        <p class="paragraph_style"><strong>Craft supply I can't live without: Mod Podge.</strong> Really, I use it all the time. Tonight, Erik is at a meetup in San Francisco, so I am fending for myself dinner-wise, listening to more jazz music, and writing in my art journal while Fiddlesticks (our cat) lays on the floor and looks at herself in our mirrored closet doors. What a lovely evening!</p>
                        <p class="paragraph_style">To make these pages, I first did the written page, gluing a sheet of ephemera to the side for a bit of layering. I also added a little left-side border with chiffon (which I ended up not needing for bridal accessories). I love having different fabrics on my pages, and also being able to write over multiple papers so it's not so plain white.</p>  
                        <p class="paragraph_style">On the other side, I painted a layer of Matte Mod Podge (which I found at Joann's) and then layed a piece of floral tissue paper over it, pressing it down slowly to get rid of bubbles. Then, the edges of the tissue were a little sticky-uppy (technical term), so I did a little more MP around them to get them to lay flat.</p>
                        <p class="paragraph_style">It turned out cute! I'm trying to decide if I need to add a photo, or just leave it to admire the black and white flowers. Thoughts?</p>

                            <li>Frank Sinatra - Luck Be a Lady</li>

                            <li>Jack Teagarden - Stars Fell on Alabama</li>
                            <li>Frank Sinatra - The Lady is a Tramp</li>
                            <li>Dean Martin - On The Street Where You Live</li>
                            <li>Ella Fitzgerald - It Don't Mean a Thing (If it Ain't Got That Swing)</li>

                        <strong>May 22, 2012</strong>
                        <p class="paragraph_style"><strong>I am learning to talk to computers.</strong> It is a strange and beautiful process, and I feel like a super-human when I figure out how to fix things. Currently I'm working on a project for my fiance's mother, who works at a church. A church with a terribly-designed website. So terrible, in fact, that she asked me, a novice-web-design-wannabe, to make a new and better one.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph_style">The thing of it is, it's a lot of work to make a website from the bottom up! People who have been doing it for a while (Erik) know the quick ways to do things, and easy ways to see what needs to be changed in the code. But, it's a short walk down the path of endless divs until you reach the point of no-return in finding your mistakes.</p>

                        <p class="paragraph_style">To help me in my journey towards understanding HTML and CSS, Erik forwards me links and signs me up for emails with tips and info for new programmers. One really great thing he sent me was a website called <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>, where you walk through exercises to get you familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which is perfect if you're just starting and don't know your tush from your elbow in terms of websites. (I got through HTML and CSS, and slowly started to go crazy trying the Javascript section. So I'm saving that for later...)</p>

                        <p class="paragraph_style">Also, if you're a girl trying to get into coding, sign up for <a href="http://skillcrush.com/" target="_blank">Skillcrush</a> emails. They send you a word-of-the-day type of thing, with some interviews or special issues, and they're cute and fun. Check out <a href="http://skillcrush.tumblr.com/post/23100887397/the-magic-of-lilypad-arduino" target="_blank">this post on an arduino</a> (which is a "Very Small Computer That You Can Make Do Neat Things") - it is a computer sewn onto felt! I'm telling you, I sort of want to make one now.</p>
